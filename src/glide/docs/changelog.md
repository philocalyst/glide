# Changelog

# 0.1.60a

## Changes {% id="0.1.60a-changes" %}

- Bumped Firefox from 148.0b15 to 149.0b8
- Added [`AddonInstalled`](autocmds.md#addoninstalled) autocmd
- Added [`ts:glide.commandline.close()`](api.md#glide.commandline.close)
- Added `:tab_duplicate` excmd
- Added `yt` normal mode keymapping to duplicate the current tab
- Added `<A-p>` normal mode keymapping to pin / unpin the current tab
  - Thanks to [@suveshmoza](https://github.com/suveshmoza) for the contribution!
- Fixed macOS distribution missing passkey entitlements
- Fixed the `:whichkey` UI disappearing after reloading the config
- Fixed `<C-d>` / `<C-u>` so they _actually_ scroll half pages instead of full pages
- Fixed (hopefully) a race condition preventing the `ConfigLoaded` autocmd from firing
- Breaking change: the [`ts:glide.unstable.split_views`](api.md#glide.unstable.split_views) API now requires numeric IDs
  - This was an upstream Firefox change.

# 0.1.59a

## Breaking change: diacritic keymaps on macOS {% id="0.1.59a-diacritics" %}

Previously on macOS if you wanted to define a keymap with the Option key, then you would have to use the diacritic version of the key as macOS uses Option to enable [diacritics](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/mh27474/mac#:~:text=Use%20key%20combinations).

By default Glide will now use the physical key pressed instead of the diacritic, for example:

```typescript
/// before
glide.keymaps.set("normal", "<A-π>", "tab_pin");

/// after
glide.keymaps.set("normal", "<A-p>", "tab_pin");
```

For more information see the [Key codes](keys.md#key-codes) docs.

## Findbar API {% id="0.1.59a-findbar" %}

This release includes support for programmatically operating the Firefox findbar. You can now open / close the findbar, and traverse through findbar matches directly from the config.

For example, a keymap that opens the findbar to search for the text that is currently selected:

```typescript
glide.keymaps.set("normal", "~", async ({ tab_id }) => {
  const selected = await glide.content.execute(
    () => window.getSelection()?.toString(),
    { tab_id },
  );
  if (!selected) {
    throw new Error("No text selected in the page");
  }
  await glide.findbar.open({ query: selected });
});
```

The full API includes:

- [`ts:glide.findbar.open()`](api.md#glide.findbar.open)
- [`ts:glide.findbar.next_match()`](api.md#glide.findbar.next_match)
- [`ts:glide.findbar.previous_match()`](api.md#glide.findbar.previous_match)
- [`ts:glide.findbar.close()`](api.md#glide.findbar.close)
- [`ts:glide.findbar.is_open()`](api.md#glide.findbar.is_open)
- [`ts:glide.findbar.is_focused()`](api.md#glide.findbar.is_focused)

## Previous / next link following {% id="0.1.59a-previous-next-links" %}

This release adds the `[[` and `]]` default keymappings in `normal` mode that will automatically follow "previous" and "next" links respectively.

For example, entering `]]` while on https://lobste.rs/active will take you to https://lobste.rs/page/2, then `[[` will take you to https://lobste.rs/page/1.

This works by searching for link elements (e.g. `html:<a>`, `html:<div role="link">`) that contain specific text (e.g. `"next"`, `"more"`). If multiple elements are found, then the element at the _bottom_ of the page is selected.

You can customise the text strings to search for with [`ts:glide.o.go_next_patterns`](api.md#glide.o.go_next_patterns) and [`ts:glide.o.go_previous_patterns`](api.md#glide.o.go_previous_patterns).
Or use different keymappings by mapping `:go_next` and `:go_previous`.

## Customisable keyboard layouts {% id="0.1.59a-keyboard-layouts" %}

Added support for resolving keymaps from the _physical_ key pressed instead of whatever key string your software layout resolved it to.

This is particularly important for users with multiple keyboard layouts, as you no longer have to define keymaps multiple times for each layout, e.g.

```typescript
/// before
// english
glide.keymaps.set("normal", "<C-t>", "tab_prev");
// russian
glide.keymaps.set("normal", "<C-т>", "tab_prev");
```

You can now tell Glide to use the physical key [`code`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/code) instead:

```typescript
/// after
glide.o.keyboard_layout = "qwerty";
glide.o.keymaps_use_physical_layout = "force";

glide.keymaps.set("normal", "<C-t>", "tab_prev");
```

> [!NOTE]
> Glide still needs a way to map the key code to the corresponding key string in mappings. For example, what should pressing `Shift` + [`Digit2`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/UI_Events/Keyboard_event_code_values#code_values_on_linux_x11:~:text=0x000B,-%22Digit2) be matched against?
>
> The answer can change depending on your specific keyboard. On a US keyboard with a qwerty layout you would expect it to match against keymaps using `@`, but on a German keyboard it should be `"`.
>
> The default keyboard layout is US qwerty. If you use a different layout, see the [`ts:glide.o.keyboard_layouts`](api.md#glide.o.keyboard_layouts) option.

## Half page scrolling {% id="0.1.59a-half-page-scrolling" %}

The `<C-d>` and `<C-u>` keymaps now scroll _half_ pages instead of full pages like they did before. This was changed to match Vim behaviour more closely.

# 0.1.58a

## Experimental windows support {% id="0.1.58a-experimental-windows-support" %}

This release adds support for Windows!

This support is marked as experimental as it has not been tested as thoroughly as Linux or macOS.
If you run into any issues please [report](https://github.com/glide-browser/glide/discussions/new?category=issue-triage) them!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Windows binaries are not signed _yet_. This means that Windows will warn you that you're installing an
> app from an "unknown publisher"; you'll have to click through these warnings if you want to try out Glide on Windows right now.

## Changes {% id="0.1.58a-changes" %}

- Bumped Firefox from 147.0b8 to 148.0b4
- Added process output helpers, `ts:await process.stdout.text()`, `ts:await process.stdout.lines()`
  - These will resolve when the process exits, if you want to consume output as soon as it is available you can async iterate instead of `await`ing
  - `ts:for await (const line of process.stdout.lines()) { ... }`
- Added support for writing to process stdin with `ts:await process.stdin.write("data")`
  - Thanks [@philocalyst](https://github.com/philocalyst) for the contribution!
  - note: you _must_ call `ts:await process.stdin.close()` for the process to exit
- Added support for registering event listeners in the browser UI
  - e.g. `ts:window.addEventListener("click", (event) => { ... })`
- Added [`ts:glide.o.newtab_url`](api.md#glide.o.newtab_url) for customising the newtab page
- Added [`ts:glide.fs.mkdir()`](api.md#glide.fs.mkdir)
- Added [`ts:Addon.reload()`](api.md#glide.Addon) for reloading an installed addon
- Added [`ts:Addon.type`](api.md#glide.Addon) for identifying the type of an addon, e.g. `extension`, `theme`, etc
- Added `yf` keymapping to copy the `href` of an element to the clipboard
  - Thanks [@suveshmoza](https://github.com/suveshmoza) for the contribution!
- Added `auto_activate: "always"` to [`ts:glide.hints.show()`](api.md#glide.hints.show) for always activating the first hint found, instead of only auto activating when there is a single hint found
- Promoted `ts:glide.unstable.include()` to [`ts:glide.include()`](api.md#glide.include)
  - note: `ts:glide.unstable.include()` still exists for backwards compatibility but it will be removed in a future release
- Fixed calling `ts:glide.commandline.show()` within an excmd
- Fixed the commandline not closing immediately if an excmd takes a long time to complete
- Fixed expanding `~` in the process `cwd`, e.g. `ts:glide.process.execute("pwd", [], { cwd: "~/.dotfiles" })`
  - Thanks [@suveshmoza](https://github.com/suveshmoza) for the contribution!
- Fixed errors while reloading the config from potentially corrupting internal state
- docs: added table of contents sidebar to [reference](api.md) pages
  - Thanks [@suveshmoza](https://github.com/suveshmoza) for the contribution!
- docs: fixed clashing `/tutorial` pages

# 0.1.57a

## Search engine configuration {% id="0.1.57a-search-engine-configuration" %}

You can now configure new search engines directly in the Glide config, for example:

```typescript
glide.search_engines.add({
  name: "Discogs",
  keyword: "disc",
  search_url:
    "https://www.discogs.com/search/?q={searchTerms}",

  // optional
  favicon_url: "https://www.discogs.com/favicon.ico",
  is_default: false,
});
```

With this example you could search using Discogs by focusing the address bar and typing `disc<space>`!

The [`glide.search_engines.add()`](api.md#glide.search_engines.add) function takes the same arguments as the `chrome_settings_overrides.search_provider` web extension manifest v2 [object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/chrome_settings_overrides#browser_compatibility).

## Changes {% id="0.1.57a-changes" %}

  - Thanks [@jyn514](https://github.com/jyn514) for the contribution!
- Updated hint generation to clear previous "No hints found" notifications when hints are eventually found
  - Thanks [@suveshmoza](https://github.com/suveshmoza) for the contribution!
- Removed Perplexity as a default search engine
- Fixed usage of the `browser` API on privileged pages
- Fixed permissions error when creating or updating tabs with a privileged URI, e.g. `browser.tabs.create({ url: "resource://glide-docs/index.html" })`
- Fixed [`glide.bo.hint_size`](api.md#glide.o.hint_size) so that it correctly applies the styling for the current buffer
- Fixed `i` sending an unnecessary `<left>` key event
- Fixed serialisation of the [`browser.contentScripts.register()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/contentScripts/register) return value. You can now access it, and call [`script.unregister()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/contentScripts/RegisteredContentScript).
- Misc

  - [Reduced](https://github.com/glide-browser/glide/pull/157) the number of redundant DOM mutations inside the commandline
    - Thanks [@suveshmoza](https://github.com/suveshmoza) for the contribution!

# 0.1.56a

## Breaking changes {% id="0.1.56a-breaking-changes" %}

### Hint callback execution {% id="0.1.56a-hint-callback-execution" %}

The `action` and `pick` callbacks are now executed in the main process, _not_ the content process. This change was made so that you can access the `glide` API in the callbacks, making them much more useful.

For example, only selecting the hint with the largest width:

```typescript {% check="false" %}
// before
glide.hints.show({
  pick: (hints) => {
    let biggest_hint = hints[0]!;
    let biggest_width = hints[0]!.element.offsetWidth;
    for (let i = 1; i < hints.length; i++) {
      const hint = hints[i]!;
      const width = hint.element.offsetWidth;
      if (width > biggest_width) {
        biggest_hint = hint;
        biggest_width = width;
      }
    }
    return [biggest_hint];
  },
});

// after
glide.hints.show({
  pick: async ({ hints, content }) => {
    const widths = await content.map((element) =>
      element.offsetWidth
    );
    let biggest_hint = hints[0]!;
    let biggest_width = widths[0]!;
    for (let i = 1; i < hints.length; i++) {
      const hint = hints[i]!;
      const width = widths[i]!;
      if (width > biggest_width) {
        biggest_hint = hint;
        biggest_width = width;
      }
    }
    return [biggest_hint];
  },
});
```

For the `action` function:

```typescript {% check="false" %}
// before
glide.hints.show({
  action: (element) => {
    element.click();
  },
});

// after
glide.hints.show({
  action: async ({ content }) => {
    await content.execute((element) => element.click());
  },
});
```

### Relative path resolution {% id="0.1.56a-hint-callback-execution" %}

Previously calls to APIs like [`glide.fs.read()`](api.md#glide.fs.read) with relative paths would resolve relative to the config file instead of the current file.

For example:

```typescript {% check="false" %}
// <config>/glide.ts
glide.unstable.include("foo/bar/stuff.glide.ts");

// <config>/foo/bar/stuff.glide.ts
glide.fs.read("data.json");
```

0.1.55a would read `path:<config>/data.json`

0.1.56a will now read `path:<config>/foo/bar/data.json`

## Custom hint label generators {% id="0.1.56a-custom-hint-label-generators" %}

You can now override label generation for hints to use whatever strategy you'd like.

For example, a _very_ naive implementation for using the first two characters of the element text as the label:

```typescript
glide.hints.show({
  label_generator: async ({ content }) => {
    const texts = await content.map((element) =>
      element.textContent!
    );
    return texts.map((text) => text.slice(0, 2));
  },
});
```

# 0.1.55a

### Picker API {% id="0.1.55a-picker-api" %}

You can now use the commandline as a picker for arbitrary options.

For example, creating a basic version of `:tab` that only shows bookmarks:

```typescript
glide.keymaps.set("normal", "<leader>o", async () => {
  const bookmarks = await browser.bookmarks.getRecent(10);

  glide.commandline.show({
    title: "bookmarks",
    options: bookmarks.map((bookmark) => ({
      label: bookmark.title,
      async execute() {
        const tab = await glide.tabs.get_first({
          url: bookmark.url,
        });
        if (tab) {
          await browser.tabs.update(tab.id, {
            active: true,
          });
        } else {
          await browser.tabs.create({
            active: true,
            url: bookmark.url,
          });
        }
      },
    })),
  });
}, { description: "Open the bookmarks picker" });
```

You can also customise how each option is displayed by providing a `render()` function on each `option` that returns a `HTMLElement`:

```typescript {% check="false" %}
{
  label: bookmark.title,
  render() {
    return DOM.create_element("div", {
      style: {
        display: "flex",
        alignItems: "center",
        gap: "8px",
      },
      children: [
        DOM.create_element("span", [bookmark.title]),
        DOM.create_element("span", [bookmark.url], {
          style: { color: "#777", fontSize: "0.9em" },
        }),
      ],
    });
  },
};
```

See the full commandline [docs](./commandline.md) for more information.

### Split views API {% id="0.1.55a-split-views" %}

> [!WARNING]
> This feature is very [early](https://connect.mozilla.org/t5/ideas/split-screen-tab-in-tab-feature-view-more-than-one-tab-at-once/idi-p/3989) in development in Firefox, there will be bugs.

Firefox has work in progress support for split views, so you can view multiple tabs at the same time.

![split views example](./split-views.webp)

You can now manage split views directly from the Glide config with [`glide.unstable.split_views`](./api.md#glide.unstable.split_views), for example:

```typescript
glide.keymaps.set(
  "normal",
  "<C-w>v",
  async ({ tab_id }) => {
    const all_tabs = await glide.tabs.query({});
    const current_index = all_tabs.findIndex((t) =>
      t.id === tab_id
    );
    const other = all_tabs[current_index + 1];
    if (!other) {
      throw new Error("No next tab");
    }
    glide.unstable.split_views.create([tab_id, other]);
  },
  {
    description:
      "Create a split view with the tab to the right",
  },
);

glide.keymaps.set(
  "normal",
  "<C-w>q",
  async ({ tab_id }) => {
    glide.unstable.split_views.separate(tab_id);
  },
  {
    description: "Close the split view for the current tab",
  },
);
```

### Changes {% id="0.1.55a-changes" %}

- Bumped Firefox from 146.0b4 to 146.0b9
- Added `gU` keymapping to go to the root of the current URL hierarchy
- Added `gu` keymapping to go up the URL hierarchy
- Added [`CommandLineExit`](./autocmds.md#CommandLineExit) autocmd
- Added [`glide.commandline.show()`](./api.md#glide.commandline.show())
- Added support for removing autocmds with [`glide.autocmds.remove()`](./api.md#glide.autocmds.remove)
- Added [`glide.content.fn()`](./api.md#glide.content.fn) for marking callbacks as executing in the content process, currently supported in `glide.keymaps.set()` and `glide.excmds.create()`
- Added [`glide.o.switch_mode_on_focus`](./api.md#glide.o.switch_mode_on_focus) for disabling automatic mode switching
- Added `children` syntax sugar to [`DOM.create_element()`](./api.md#DOM.create_element) so you can now do `DOM.create_element('div', ['child'], { ...props })`
- Made the [`glide.o`](./api.md#glide.o) type extensible
- Fixed [`glide.keys.send()`](./api.md#glide.keys.send) potentially resulting in out-of-order key events
- Fixed the [`glide.o.yank_highlight`](./api.md#glide.o.yank_highlight) type to allow `rgb(255, 255, 255)` strings

# 0.1.54a

Page navigation keys (`h`, `j`, `k`, `l`, `<C-u>`, `<C-d>`, `gg`, and `G`) are now translated into equivalent standard keys:

- `hjkl` to arrow keys
- `<C-u>` to `<PageUp>`
- `<C-d>` to `<PageDown>`
- `gg` to `<D-Up>` on macOS, and `<C-Home>` on Linux
- `G` to `<D-Down>` on macOS, and `<C-End>` on Linux

For example, when you press `j`, Glide will now send an `<ArrowDown>` event to the web page.

This change was made for a couple reasons:

1. We get to leverage Firefox's smooth scrolling implementation.
2. The aforementioned keys are now more likely to _just work_ as you'd expect.
   Scrolling in PDFs now works; websites with their own scrolling behaviour will now work, as long as they support standard navigation keys.

#### Website key events {% id="0.1.54a-website-key-events" %}

There is a notable behaviour change here now that navigation keys send key events to the web page; websites can now intercept those key events and function differently. This may or may not be desirable depending on the website you are using.

If this behaviour is worse for you, please open a [discussion](https://github.com/glide-browser/glide/discussions), and if needed you can revert to the previous implementation with:

```typescript
glide.o.scroll_implementation = "legacy";
```

> [!TIP]
> This behaviour can be worse when custom elements are focused, e.g. YouTube videos as `j` will turn the volume down when you really want to scroll the page.
>
> In these cases you can try pressing `<C-,>` first to move focus off of that element.

### Smooth scrolling {% id="0.1.54a-smooth-scrolling" %}

Smooth scrolling is now supported, and enabled by default.

If you want to keep instant scrolling you can use this config:

```typescript
glide.prefs.set("general.smoothScroll", false);
```

Note that this also changes the scroll behaviour when using arrow keys directly.

- Updated `:clear` to also dismiss app menu notifications, e.g. the "New update available" notification
- Disabled more AI prefs
- We now store the previous Glide versions you've used in the profile directory

# 0.1.53a

### Addons API {% id="0.1.53a-addons-api" %}

You can now install addons directly from the Glide config:

```typescript {% copy=false %}
glide.addons.install(
  "https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4598854/ublock_origin-1.67.0.xpi",
);
```

This will install the [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/ublock-origin) addon, if it isn't _already_ installed. If you want to install the addon even if it's installed already, use `glide.addons.install('...', { force: true })`.

`glide.addons.install()` expects a URL for an [XPI](https://file-extensions.com/docs/xpi) file, you can obtain the XPI URL from an [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org) page by right clicking on "Add to Firefox", and selecting "Copy link".

### Styles API {% id="0.1.53a-addons-api" %}

You can now easily inject custom CSS into the browser UI directly from the Glide config:

```typescript
glide.styles.add(css`
  #TabsToolbar {
    visibility: collapse !important;
  }
`);
```

This particular example hides the horizontal native tabs toolbar, but you can customise essentialy anything in the browser UI with this method.

Note that prior to this release you could inject custom CSS yourself but it was slower and would be persisted between config reloads.

```typescript
glide.autocmds.create("WindowLoaded", () => {
  document.head!.appendChild(DOM.create_element("style", {
    textContent: css`
      #TabsToolbar {
        visibility: collapse !important;
      }
    `,
  }));
});
```

# 0.1.52a

- Bumped Firefox from 144.0b8 to 144.0b9.
- Fixed synthesizing special keys, e.g. `glide.keys.send("<down>")`.
- Fixed the font family for hints, it now falls back to monospace instead of serif.
- Fixed locale fetching, you can now download locales other than en-US in the settings page.
- Fixed incorrect "new update" notification under certain conditions.

# 0.1.51a

### Breaking changes {% id="0.1.51a-breaking-changes" %}

On Linux, the `<C-l>` and `<C-h>` mappings, to go backwards and forwards in history, have been changed to `<A-l>` and `<A-h>` respectively.

This change was made to prevent a conflict with the default `<C-l>` keymap in Firefox that focuses the address bar.

### Changes {% id="0.1.51a-changes" %}

- Bumped Firefox from 144.0b5 to 144.0b8.
- Fixed keymap autocompletion for `glide.keymaps.del()`.
- Fixed bad handling of invalid `focusin` events.
- Added `<C-[>` in `insert`, `visual`, and `op-pending` mode to switch back to `normal` mode.

# 0.1.50a

- Added `glide.fs.stat()`.
- Added `glide.env.get()`, `glide.env.set()`, and `glide.env.delete()`. This is particularly useful for configuring your `PATH` on macOS.
- Added some missing types to the API docs.
- Bumped Firefox from 144.0b5 to 144.0b6.
- Fixed mappings with shift and multiiple modifiers, e.g. `cmd+shift+c` now works.
- Fixed the native messaging runtime path, previously the paths were the Firefox defaults now:
  - macOS system: `/Library/Application Support/Glide Browser`
  - macOS user: `~/Library/Application Support/Glide Browser`
  - Linux system: `/usr/lib64/glide-browser` (or `/usr/lib/glide-browser`)
  - Linux user: `path:~/.glide-browser`
- Removed support for the `browser` API inside the hints content callbacks, e.g. `glide.hints.show({ pick: () => ... })`.
  This was the only place it was accessible and allowing access to the `browser` API from the content frame has security implications
  that need to be investigated further.

# 0.1.49a

- Fixed a case where dev tools autocomplete could stop working
- Changed `glide.ctx.url` from a `string` to a `URL`
- Bumped Firefox from 144.0b3 to 144.0b5

# 0.1.48a

- Updated the recommended tsconfig to more accurately reflect reality
- Added support for setting attributes using `DOM.create_element()`
- Added `ts:glide.fs.write(path, contents)`
- Added `window` to the config sandbox
- Cleaned up the `document` mirror in the config sandbox
  - `html:<browser>` and `html:<scripts>` elements are no longer included
  - Fixed race conditions when mutating the `document`
  - Added many missing elements

# 0.1.47a

- Fixed a case where the browser toolbox devtools could crash
- Fixed issues with certain functions not being callable in the config, e.g. `ts:setTimeout()`
- Prevented timers from being throttled, namely `ts:setTimeout()`, `ts:setInterval()` and `ts:requestIdleCallback()`
- Fixed `ts:requestAnimationFrame()` never firing
- Added `ts:glide.fs.exists(path)`
- Upated Firefox from `path:144.0b1` to `path:144.0b3`

# 0.1.46a

- Added `ts:glide.fs.read(path, encoding)`
- Added `ts:glide.process.spawn(command, args, opts)`
- Added `ts:glide.process.execute(command, args, opts)`

# 0.1.45a

This release fixes a regression with the document mirror causing a crash when multiple windows are opened.

# 0.1.44a

This release restructures how the config sandbox is evaluated. Previously, it was possible to access the internal `Document` and `ChromeWindow` that Firefox uses to render the browser UI itself.
This is useful for accessing DOM APIs, e.g. `URL`, and allowing you to modify the UI in any way you want, however it introduces security concerns as _all_ of the Glide and Firefox internals can be accessed directly, effectively nullifying the sandbox.

Now, we create a hidden `Window` and a `Document` that is a bi-directional mirror of the internal browser UI `Document`. This lets you modify the `Document` however you'd like using standard DOM APIs while maintaining isolation from the internals.

Firefox has been bumped from `path:143.0b9` to `path:144.0b1`, the Firefox release notes can be found [here](https://www.firefox.com/en-US/firefox/143.0/releasenotes/).

# 0.1.43a

This release is mostly minor docs changes and an internal rehaul of the build system.

# 0.1.42a

Initial public release!
